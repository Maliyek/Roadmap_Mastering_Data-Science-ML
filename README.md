Python supports n-dimensional arrays with Numpy. For data in 2-dimensions, Pandas is the best library for analysis. You can use other tools but tools have drag-and-drop features and have limitations. Pandas can be customized as per the need as we can code depending upon the real-life problem.

- Slicing, Rows, and Columns
- Operations on DataFrame
- Different ways to create DataFrame
- Read, Write Operations with CSV files
- Handling Missing values, replace values, and Regular Expression
- GroupBy and Concatenation
